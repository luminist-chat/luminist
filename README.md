## Why Luminist?

Modern AI chat solutions are all severely lacking the ability to reason deeply through documents within domains that are highly ontologically complex.  Many of these solutions just rely on a simple similarity search for their RAG, which is often insufficient to provide a holistic understanding of a topic to answer a user's question.

The addition of a dynamically generated knowledge graph is key in order to gain an understanding of how concepts interconnect together, in order to gain deeper, ontology-driven insights.
